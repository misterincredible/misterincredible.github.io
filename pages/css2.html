                    <h3>Connecting with selectors</h3>
                    <p>As we learned, the most common connection between HTML and CSS is the selector. If you define a class with a div, you are able to "open" it in CSS. The selector marks in CSS what the div marked in HTML, this is why every class selector needs to be connected to a div, it seems to be logical, that every selector needs something he has to select. To get more into it look back to Unit 1 or try to find more information in our <a href="lexicon.html">lexicon</a>.</p>
                    <h3>img src</h3>
                    <p>We learned very early (in the basic section it was) about the img-tag. If you want to add pictures (of course we also learned that) you normally use this tag to link them with HTML. Why do we talk about that? Basicly it's just a reminder for you, but don't forget, that pictures have different sizes. This time we are going to look at how that works. If you want to make your pics smaller you can not just put it into a div-class. Try to write the class right behind the src="x"-thing and look what happens. Genius, isn't it?</p>
                    <h3>Links in the head of the HTML</h3>
                    <p>You may ask now what this site has do do with CSS, but we will explain you soon. If you want to add a selector to a CSS, you need to link it to your HTML-document. The syntax of that link should look like this (see another time in <a href="basics.html">the basics in Unit 1</a>).<em> link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css href="x"</em>. Remember that we are leaving away the opening < and the closing > , because of problems it could cause with the browser. Those need to be placed at the begin and end of that whole tag. If you want to see it again join Unit 1 again, as we pointed out earlier or click right mouse button and open inspector by clicking lowest option. Remember the moment you maybe asked why this is advanced CSS styling. Here is why: We just "opened" a gate to CSS with those linking methods, which you hopefully just learned. Even if there's not been a challenge on this so far (because itÂ´s the first course of the second Unit), we hope that you try that over and over, because this is <strong>very amazing important</strong>.</p>
