        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p>CSS is our stylesheet, everything we want our webpage to look like begins and ends with CSS. Normally we link a CSS-data to our HTML-document, but you are also allowed to write your CSS in the HTML. We will just cover CSS-data, which is linked to HTML. If you're asking, what to do with CSS, we will explain you. CSS is used to create geonemtric figures and styling text. ItÂ´s usefull to style the layout of a website too.</p>
        <h3>Styling text</h3>
        <p>Styling text might be the easiest thing about CSS. To style your text, you need a property, which is comparable to an HTML-element. Each property needs to be connected to selector. The properties value stands just behind it (devided by an :) and closed up by a ;. After that the properties values get executed on the HTML-element of the selectors. To style text there are lots of propertys available, here the most important ones:</p>
        <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>color</strong>: changes the colour of your text</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>background-color</strong>: changes the colour of your texts background (more about that down this site)</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>width, height</strong>: changes width/height of your background</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>font-family</strong>: changes the font-style</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>font-size</strong>: changes the size of the font</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
         <ul>
            <il>
                <p><strong>border</strong>: changes the kind of border your background uses</p>
            </il>
        </ul>
        <p>More usefull properties and how to use them can you find in our <a href="lexicon.html">lexicon</a>.<p>

        <h3>Creating rectangles</h3>
        <p>If you want to create a rectangle, you have to define a height and a width. If you don't see anything, don't wonder, because to make it visible, you have to add borders (more about this in Unit 2). After doing that you can see the rectangle and of course edit the background colour.</p>
