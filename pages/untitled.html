            <h3>How can you structure your HTML-document?</h3>
            <p>Structuring your HTML is different, because it getÂ´s quite long. This is why it's a good idea to use paragraphs and indents. To make clear which tags belong where and last to which point of your document, use indents. Every new layer get's a new indent and if you close a point do the same with your indent. Last but not least, seperate different topics from each other, by using paragraphs.</p>
            <h3>General structure</h3>
            <p>If you write a HTML you need to use a basic structure. Open <strong>and close</strong> every tag. The structure of the opening tag should look like this: First the opening <, then the closing >. Between those you have to write the element you want to use, if you write a closing tag, do the same, but add a / in between the element and the <. Things which stand between the opening and closing tag will be interpreted as parts of it, so if you might open a div and forget to close it, the Browser will try to interpret everything under the opening div-tag as a part of the div.</p>

            <p>That's right!!!</p>
            <img src="../images/Wrong.png"></img>
            <p>That is unfortunally wrong!!!</p>
            <h3>Structuring tip</h3>
            <p>If you look at the pictures above, you'll notice, that the element div has a class="x" behind it, that's what you could do to. If you have multiple tags, which are supposed to have the same characteristics, we already learned, that it's a clever idea to use divs. Just use that structure and  create a class. Give it a name and then you're able to use it in CSS. Read more about .class in the second Unit about advanced CSS-styling.</p>
            <h3>CSS Syntax</h3>
            <p>CSS syntax is very easy, because you don't need a closing tag. There's not much to talk about, which is why we will just start with the Syntax. To understand everything clear, read carefully now: The main parts of a CSS <strong>rule</strong> are the <strong>properties</strong>, their <strong>values</strong> and the <strong>selector</strong>. The selector "selects" a part of an HTML-document, which needs to be eddited. The selector defines what needs to be changed and last but not least the value shows how much it needs to be changed. So the CSS-Syntax works like that: selector { property: value; }. By the way, there's two important kinds of selectors: the class selector and the element selector. You can find more about that in Unit 2 and our <a href="lexicon.html">lexicon</a>.</p>
            <h3>Last but not least</h3>
            <p>Keep it <strong>DRY</strong>! (which should mean <strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself)</p>
        <div class="Dry">
