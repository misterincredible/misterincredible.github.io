       <h3>Explaining you the most usefull elements</h3>
       <p> There are multiple categories of elements, so they are devided in which content they fit. If we talk about text items, we mean those ones, which write text on your page. We are going to explain the ones we will use in this workshop in the list under this introduction.</p>

       <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>

       <p><strong>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</strong>: Those ones are very usefull, if you want to highlight things in your text. The h stands for heading, which actually means, that your text will be set up to be the biggest and most important item on the site. If you want to write subheadings you will notice why you need the numbers. The biggest number marks the biggest heading. If you use h1 for highlighting the main heading, you usually use h3 to mark the subheading. If you just want to know, how it works, look up on this site with right mouse click and a click on the lowest option.</p>

       <h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs and highlighted text</h3>

       <p><strong>p, strong, em</strong>: If you want to add normal text, you need to add the p-item to your HTML-document. The p-item is supposed to write standard text and is oftenly used to write descriptions between headings and subheadings. It is used just like the h-element. If you want to highlight a word in a p-tag, you need to add a strong-tag or a em-tag. Those two have different ways of highlighting your text. Strong will make your text thick, em will make it italic.</p>

       <p>Now we go on to the list elements. A list element is useful, when it comes to structuring a webpage. With the help of those elements you can build charts, menus and list important facts.</p>

       <h3 id="list">the ul- and li-items</h3>

       <p><strong>ul, li</strong>: If you want to list something, those two items could be very useful to your already known assets. The ul- (unsorted list) and li (list items)-elements help you to structure a homepages menu or crossbar. With the element ul you'll be able to create a list. If you jump down one paragraph you have to write the li-tag, mentioning the item, you want to add to the list right behind it. This is how you define each item of your unsorted list</p>

       <p>We talked a lot about special elements and how to use 'em, but now itÂ´s time to look at general structures, which need to be in every HTML-document.</p>

       <h3 id="main">Main elements</h3>

       <p><strong>html, head, meta, title, body</strong>: On the top of each site needs to be a basic structure, which we will explain now. First you need to write !DOCTYPE html to show the browser, that the following document is HTML, then write down html. That is very important, because it defines where the HTML starts and where it ends. Then write head to define the top of your HTML and after that links you might need, because the browser has to use two documents or a stylesheet ect.. After that write down the meta (meta charset="UTF-8") and add the title your page should have (in the Browser). Close the head and open the body. This is where everything shown on the site needs to be placed. Not mentioned yet, but to define the end of an element, you have to close it, with a closing tag.</p>

       <img src="../images/HTML%20head.png"></img>

       <p>Now we are going to learn something about different types of links. Links are the heart and soul of styling a website and the gate to CSS, this is why you need to follow those instructions very carefully.

         <h3 id="links">Links</h3>

         <p><strong>link, a href</strong>: If you want to link a document to your HTML you can use link and a href="x". (x stands for what you want to add). Before the closing tag write the text, your link should have or do it, like in the example above shown. That is very easy, hope you will understand that quickly.

             <h3 id="images">Images</h3>

             <p><strong>img src</strong>: If you need images to decorate your webpage (as you know, a pic is worth than thousand words) you can just use the img-tag. Using this tag you're able to not just put pictures on your site, you also can arrange them in CSS and style it like that. You use the img-item just like the a- or link-item. If you have multiple pictures you want to cover you can use a div to pack them into one tag.</p>

             <h3 id="divs">Divs</h3>

             <p><strong>div</strong>: Using divs can be very useful, if you want to define classes or cover two items in one tag, a <em>div-tag</em>. How to use those divs will be explained later, when we style our text.
