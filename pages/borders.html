        <h3>How you should use borders</h3>
        <p>Borders are a good way to style your HTML and one of the biggest parts of layouting your page and using CSS. Earlier we talked about borders and now you might ask what we were talking about, well here is the explanation to your question. Borders are just that, what they are called. They mark the borders of elements (more about those down this site) You can use them for multiple purposes. The Syntax is quite easy, because we are talking about CSS-properties. Remember the CSS-Syntax from Unit 1? Here we go, this is how to structure it</p>
        <h3>Some knowledge about elements</h3>
        <p>So, this is going to be very short. Talking about elements, there are 3 types: block, inline and inline-block. You might associate them with the layouting modes in MS Word. The inline-element is structured like the textbox in Word. This element is found, as the name says, <strong>inline</strong>. The block-element is comparable to the geonemetric figures in MS Office, it's found <strong>outline</strong>. A inline-block-element is a mixture of both things. It's a block element, which you can find <strong>inline</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Creating circles</h3>
        <p>This one is a little bit more complex. To understand it you got to try it yourself and think of geometry, think it was 9th class at high school. Remember how many corners a circle has? 0? No, that's wrong, a circle has infinitely corners. The difference might be small, but very important for the following lesson. In CSS and HTML a circle has 4 corners. Guess what comes next. In CSS a circle looks like rectangle. But which: it looks like a square. The circle is, like we just learned, a manipulated square. But how do you manipulate it? This is the moment when you need borders. Remember, a border shows where an element ends, what would happen if the border would be "wrong". Yeah! This is what we are going to do now. If we manipulate the radius of the border, the <strong>border-radius</strong> (new property), we will create a circle, set the border radius to 50% and see what happens. A circle! If you want to make other objects with round parts in it you can use the border-radius too. You have to set the radius for each corner in your rectangle itself. This property is called <strong>border-top/bottom-left/right-radius</strong> and is used just like the border-radius.</p>
        <h3>border values</h3>
        <p>Now in a short paragraph you will learn how to write the <strong>border</strong>-property, another new property. It's used to make the border visible and here is how to use it. After the : write how thick the border should be and then what kind of border you want to use. Last but not least select your colour. All in all it should look like this and round the whole lesson up: border: 1px dotted/solid colour.</p>
        <h3>Margin and Padding</h3>
        <p>A border is a kind of 3 of those properties. The other two are called margin and padding. Learn more about those in Unit 3 or in our <a href="lexicon.html">lexicon</a>.</p>
